## Why
Because the easier it is for you to access you code documentation, the more likely you are to use it. And with this plugin you have it one keypress away.

## Should I use doge or dooku?

* [What is vim-doge](https://github.com/kkoomen/vim-doge): Helper to write code comments inside your code.
* [What is dooku.nvim](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim): It generates the actual `html` documentation, and open it on your internet browser. Depending the language it will use `doxygen`, `typedoc`, `jsdoc`, `rustdoc`, `godoc`, or any other.

## Supported languages 

| Language | Generator |
|--|--|
| `c` | doxygen |
| `c++` | doxygen |
| `c# `| doxygen |
| `objective-c` | doxygen |
| `java` | doxygen | 
| `python` | doxygen |
| `php` | doxygen |
| `typescript` | typedoc |
| `javascript` | jsdoc |
| `rust` | rustdoc |
| `go`| godoc |

Not supported yet â†’ Pull requests are welcome

| Language | Generator |
|--|--|
| `lua` | ldoc |
| `ruby` | yard |

## Required system dependencies
```sh
# Pacman is the arch linux package manager.
# Use the equivalent command of your distro.
sudo pacman -S doxygen rust go
npm install -g typedoc jdoc
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc@latest
```
Then run `:checkhealth dooku` to check if everything is OK.

## How to install
lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "Zeioth/dooku.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  opts = {
    -- your config options here
  },
},
```

## Commands
| Command | Description|
|--|--|
| `:DookuAutoSetup` | It will download a config file in your project root directory, so you can run `:DookuGenerate` without having to configure anything. Not necessary for `rust` and `go`. |
| `:DookuGenerate` | Generate the HTML documentation using the adecuated generator for the current filetype. |
| `:DookuOpen` | Open the HTML documentation using the specified program, or the default internet browser. |

## Options
```lua
project_root = { '.git', '.hg', '.svn', '.bzr', '_darcs', '_FOSSIL_', '.fslckout' } -- when one of these files is found, consider that directory the project root. Search starts upwards from the current buffer.
browser_cmd = "xdg-open"     -- write your internet browser here. If unset, it will attempt to detect it automatically.

-- automations
on_bufwrite_generate = true  -- auto run :DookuGenerate when a buffer is written.
on_generate_open = true      -- auto open when running :DookuGenerate. This options is not triggered by on_bufwrite_generate.
auto_setup = true            -- auto download a config for the generator if it doesn't exist in the project.

-- notifications
on_generate_notification = false
on_open_notification = false
```

* (Optional) These options can be accessed from anywhere with `vim.g.dooku_config`
* (Optional) We also expose [debug options](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim/wiki/debug-options) to control how the plugin work internally.

## Basic usage
Run the commands in this order

* `:DookuAutoSetup`
* `:DookuGenerate`
* `:DookuOpen`

Or if you prefer run `:DookuGenerate` three times. This is only necessary the first time.

## FAQ
* **Doesn't work?** Make sure you have installed the [required dependencies](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim#required-system-dependencies).
* **Still doesn't work?** Make sure you have one of the items defined in the option `project_root` in your project root directory, or dooku.nvim might end up on the wrong directory silently.
* **Still doesn't work?** If you are on `rust / go` you must initialize your project with `cargo new your_project_name` or `go mod init your_module_name`. Also ensure the generated `Cargo.toml` or `go.mod` are in the same dir as the `project_root`.
* **STILL doesn't work?** Then congratulations, you found a bug. Please [report it here](https://github.com/Zeioth/dooku.nvim/issues) so I can fix it.
* **How can I add support for a new language?** On the `backends` directory, copy the file `doxygen.lua`, and and use it as base to add your new documentation generator. On `options.lua`, copy all the doxygen specific options, and rename them to the language you are adding. Finally, on `commands.lua`, add your language to the if condition of the functions `generate`, `open`, and `auto_setup`, so your backend is recognized and loaded. Don't forget to send your PR so everyone can benefit from it!
* **Where do that cheesy name come from?** From [Star Wars](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku).
* **Is this plugin based on some other** This is a lua port of the vim plugin [vim-dooku](https://github.com/Zeioth/vim-dooku).

## Roadmap
* In order to ensure windows compatibility we must use `jobstart`and `jobstop`.
* We could change the `args` options to get a string instead of a array, which is desireable.
